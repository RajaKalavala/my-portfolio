# 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Hostinger hosting account
- Domain name configured in Hostinger
- File Manager access or FTP credentials

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### 1. Build Your React App (Already Done!)
```bash
npm run build
```
✅ **Build completed successfully!** Your optimized files are in the `build/` folder.

### 2. Access Your Hostinger Control Panel
1. Log in to your Hostinger account
2. Go to your hosting control panel
3. Navigate to **File Manager** or use **FTP**

### 3. Upload Files to Hostinger

#### Option A: Using File Manager (Recommended)
1. **Open File Manager** in your Hostinger control panel
2. **Navigate to public_html** (or your domain's root directory)
3. **Delete existing files** (if any) in public_html
4. **Upload all files** from the `build/` folder to public_html:
   - `index.html`
   - `asset-manifest.json`
   - `.htaccess`
   - `static/` folder (with CSS and JS files)
   - `images/` folder (with your photo)

#### Option B: Using FTP
1. **Get FTP credentials** from Hostinger control panel
2. **Use an FTP client** (FileZilla, WinSCP, etc.)
3. **Connect to your server** using FTP credentials
4. **Upload all files** from `build/` to `public_html/`

### 4. File Structure on Hostinger
Your domain root should look like this:
```
public_html/
├── index.html
├── asset-manifest.json
├── .htaccess
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── main.286dff60.css
│   └── js/
│       └── main.04947729.js
└── images/
    └── raja-kalavala.jpg
```

### 5. Configure Domain (If Needed)
1. **Go to Domains** in Hostinger control panel
2. **Point your domain** to the hosting account
3. **Set up DNS** if using a custom domain

### 6. Test Your Website
1. **Visit your domain** in a browser
2. **Test all sections**: Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Projects, Contact
3. **Test responsive design** on mobile devices
4. **Test dark/light mode** toggle

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. **404 Errors on Page Refresh**
- ✅ **Solution**: The `.htaccess` file handles this automatically

#### 2. **Images Not Loading**
- ✅ **Solution**: Ensure `images/` folder is uploaded to public_html

#### 3. **CSS/JS Files Not Loading**
- ✅ **Solution**: Check that `static/` folder is uploaded correctly

#### 4. **Slow Loading**
- ✅ **Solution**: The build is optimized and `.htaccess` includes compression

## 📱 Performance Optimization

Your build includes:
- ✅ **Gzipped files** for faster loading
- ✅ **Optimized images** and assets
- ✅ **Browser caching** configured
- ✅ **Security headers** enabled
- ✅ **Compression** enabled

## 🔄 Updating Your Website

To update your website in the future:

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Run build**: `npm run build`
3. **Upload new files** to Hostinger (replace old files)
4. **Clear browser cache** to see changes

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check Hostinger support** for hosting-specific issues
2. **Verify file permissions** (should be 644 for files, 755 for folders)
3. **Check error logs** in Hostinger control panel
